[Firefox Addon]()

This is a simple HTML page styled similar to [Firefox's new brand identity](https://mozilla.design/firefox/) that shows a clock and the date. It was a fun project to use my CSS skills and to learn a bit more about Firefox extensions.

Tips and improvements are always welcome!
