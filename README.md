This is a simple HTML page styled similar to [Firefox's new brand identity](https://mozilla.design/firefox/) that shows a clock and the date. It was a fun project to use my CSS skills and to learn a bit more about Firefox extensions.

*Not optimized for mobiles.*

Tips and improvements are always welcome!

This page uses the awesome [Metropolis](https://github.com/chrismsimpson/Metropolis) font.
